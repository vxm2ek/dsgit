echo "I used to spend 80 hours a week training for $NOUN1.
Eventually all of the $VERB1 involved in $NOUN1 burnedme out, so I quit. 
My world turned from darkness into a thousand shades of $ADJ. 
I decided to adopt a pet $NOUN2. I named it $ADJ pie in honor of my perspective of life now. 
I admired $ADJ pie's tendency to be so $ADJ2. 
We loved to $VERB2 together. 
I became known as the most $ADJ3 person in all of $NOUN3.
The End."
